So I've finally caved and created my own blog. Expect posts about technology only - networking, data centres, open source software - that kind of stuff. If you're interested in mundane stuff like pictures of food, holidays, beer bottles or such, I suggest you go look somewhere else.

The reasons why it has taken me so long to get started with blogging include:

1. I have no desire to do *any* kind of web design or deal with HTML
2. I have no desire to host a big and com

 I opted for the easiest solution possible that allows me to maintain everything as plain text files in a [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) repo. So I found [tinypress.co](https://tinypress.co).

 blog is hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which means the source is available at [github.com/toreanderson/toreanderson.github.io](http://github.com/toreanderson/toreanderson.github.io). Be nice. Give credit. Share, don't steal :)

By the way, this blog is powered by [tinypress.co](https://tinypress.co).
