## The problem

As I noted in my [previous post](/2015/08/29/first-post.html), [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (just like [GitHub](https://github.com/)
itself) does not support IPv6. This is because GitHub Pages' CDN provider,
[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), doesn't support it:

````console
$ host toreanderson.github.io
toreanderson.github.io is an alias for github.map.fastly.net.
github.map.fastly.net has address 185.31.17.133
````

I find this very disappointing. Fastly was founded in 2011, so they are a
rather new CDN. Their platform is built on top of
[Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/), which has to the best of my
knowledge supported IPv6 even before Fastly was founded, so it's not like their
lack of IPv6 could be explained by having legacy and difficult to upgrade
IPv4-only internal infrastructure. I find it rather ironic that a provider
calling themselves ***Fast****ly* fails to support the protocol that was
recently [reported by Facebook to yield 30-40% faster time-to-last-byte web
page load times than IPv4](https://youtu.be/An7s25FSK0U?t=18m53s). So in case
anyone from Fastly is reading this, I suggest you either ***a)*** start
supporting IPv6 ASAP, or failing that, ***b)*** rename your CDN platform to
something more appropriate, like ***Slow****ly*.

## The workaround

My [employer](http://www.redpill-linpro.com/) is kind enough to provide me with
a virtual machine I can use for personal purposes. This server runs Linux,
[Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) Trusty LTS to be specific. It is of course
available over both IPv6 as well as IPv4 (using
[SIIT-DC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-siit-dc)), so the idea
here is to use it to provide a dual-stacked fa√ßade, thus concealing the fact
that the GitHub Pages service doesn't support IPv6.

As this server is already hosting my [sorry excuse for a home
page](http://toreanderson.no/), it had already the
[Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) web server software installed. Apache comes
with [mod_proxy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html),
which is perfectly suited for what I want to do.

The first order of business is to ensure the `mod_proxy` module is loaded. On
Ubuntu, this is easiest done using the `a2enmod` utility:

````console
# a2enmod proxy_http
Considering dependency proxy for proxy_http:
Enabling module proxy.
Enabling module proxy_http.
To activate the new configuration, you need to run:
  service apache2 restart
# service apache2 restart
 * Restarting web server apache2                              [ OK ]
````

The next order of business is to create a `VirtualHost` definition that uses
`mod_proxy` to forward all incoming HTTP requests to GitHub Pages. I did this
by creating a new file `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/http_blog.fud.no.conf` with
the contents below, before reloading the configuration with the command
`apache2ctl graceful`.

````apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName blog.toreanderson.no
	ServerAlias blog.fud.no
	ProxyPass "/" "http://toreanderson.github.io/"
	ProxyPassReverse "/" "http://toreanderson.github.io/"
</VirtualHost>
````

The `ProxyPass` directive makes incoming HTTP requests from clients be
forwarded to [http://toreanderson.github.io/](http://toreanderson.github.io/).
`ProxyPassReverse` ensures that any HTTP headers containing the string
**http://toreanderson.github.io/** in the server response from GitHub Pages
will be changed back to **http://blog.toreanderson.no/** (or
**http://blog.fud.no/**). I'm not exactly sure if `ProxyPassReverse` is really
needed for GitHub Pages, but it doesn't hurt to have it in the configuration
anyway.

The final order of business is to ensure that the two hostnames mentioned in
the `ServerName` and `ServerAlias` directives exist in DNS and are pointing to
the server. I did this by adding simply adding `IN CNAME` records that points
to an already existing hostname with IPv4 `IN A` and IPv6 `IN AAAA` records:

````console
$ host -t CNAME blog.fud.no.
blog.fud.no is an alias for fud.no.
$ host -t CNAME blog.toreanderson.no.
blog.toreanderson.no is an alias for fud.no.
$ host -t A fud.no.
fud.no has address 87.238.60.0
$ host -t AAAA fud.no.
fud.no has IPv6 address 2a02:c0:1001:100::145
````

Another thing worth mentioning here: By using my own domain names, I am also
making sure that my blog's URL is [secured using
DNSSEC](http://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/blog.toreanderson.no), another
important piece of Internet technology that GitHub Pages and Fastly currently
[neglect to
support](http://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/toreanderson.github.io).

## Summary

With the help of Apache `mod_proxy`,
[http://blog.toreanderson.no](http://blog.toreanderson.no) is now [available
over both IPv4 and
IPv6](http://validador.ipv6.br/index.php?site=blog.toreanderson.no&lang=en). I
am therefore now comfortable with letting people know that this blog actually
exists. While this workaround is far from ideal from a technical point of view,
it is better than the alternative - having to wait an indeterminate amount of
time for Fastly to get around to dual-stacking their CDN.
